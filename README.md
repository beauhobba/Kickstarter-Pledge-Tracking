# Kickstarter-Pledge-Tracking
Tracks the pledges of select kickstarters. 

## Aim

This project aims to monitor several Kickstarters from start to finish, focusing on analyzing pledge amounts using quantitative methods. With a strong data-driven approach, I seek to uncover unique trends in each Kickstarter. The script will run every 2 hours to gather data on these projects.

## Limitations
At the moment, I'm only monitoring a specific group of Kickstarters and don't plan to track every ongoing project. My focus is primarily on gathering data related to card games. However, the URLs mentioned in the code can be easily modified to accommodate other projects of interest.

## Roost
The main objective of the GitHub library is to provide tailored data for my own Kickstarter project called Roost. As Roost is currently in its pre-launch phase, it would be beneficial if you could take a look at the page!
